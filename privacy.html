        relates to you in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy. We will only collect information where it is
        necessary for us to do so and we will only collect information if it is relevant to our dealings with
        you.<br><br>We will only keep your information for as long as we are either required to by law or as is relevant
        for the purposes for which it was collected.<br><br>You can visit the Site and browse without having to provide
